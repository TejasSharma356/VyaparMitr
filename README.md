### Smart Compliance & Return Preparation App for MSMEs

VyaparMitr is a mobile application designed to help small business owners (MSMEs), freelancers, and local businesses understand, prepare, and manage their tax and compliance obligations in a simple, guided way.

The app focuses on **clarity, guidance, and preparation** — not direct government filing. It helps users know what applies to them, organize their data, and prepare returns with reduced confusion and fewer mistakes.

## 🏗 Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React Native (Expo)
- JavaScript (NO TypeScript)

**Architecture:**
- Frontend‑only (no backend for now)
- Mock APIs and mock data
- Backend‑ready structure for future integration

---

## 📁 Project Structure

/screens  
/components  
/navigation  
/services  
/context  
/utils  
/constants  
/mockData  

**Important Rule:**  
All data flows through a centralized `apiService.js` using mock async functions.  
No hardcoded business logic inside screens.

## 🤖 Chatbot & Guidance (Concept)

VyaparMitr includes a contextual guidance assistant that:
- Knows the user’s current step
- Understands business profile
- Provides step‑by‑step explanations
- Uses structured, source‑backed guidance (mocked)

This is designed to later integrate with a backend + LLM system.

## 🔒 What This App Is NOT

- Not a replacement for government portals  
- Not a direct tax filing system  
- Not a legal or CA replacement  

VyaparMitr is a **preparation, guidance, and confidence‑building tool.**

---

## 🛠 Setup & Run (Frontend)

```

- LLM‑powered guidance assistant
- Multi‑language support
- CA / accountant collaboration features

- npx expo start

## 📌 Project Goal

To build a realistic, professional compliance‑assistance product that:
